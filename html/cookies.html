Then add this creamy egg mixture to the butter-sugar bowl and mix well using a spoon. Also, add vanilla extract and mix the ingredients well. Take another bowl and add all purpose flour in it.

<br><b>Step 3:Make a thick batter</b><br>
Now, add cocoa powder and baking soda in the bowl of flour and mix salt in it. Once the flour mixture is done, add butter-egg mixture in the flour bowl and whisk well. Afterwards, add chocolate chips in this mixture and stir well.

<br><b></b>Step 4 Bake the cookies</b><br>
Now, preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Take a baking sheet and put a spoonful of creamed mixture onto the baking sheet. Make sure you leave some space in between these spoonfuls of the batter.

<br><b>tep 5:Cook for 10 minutes</b><br>
