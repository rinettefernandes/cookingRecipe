        People have experiences around food. They celebrate birthdays, holidays, and anniversaries.
        They have a romantic dinner for two. We feed our family and have conversations around the dinner table. We celebrate with friends. Or kickback with a cocktail.
        Food is part of our experience. And here at Tastegy.com, we hope to be a small part of helping create those memories.
